SWRC Fit Version History

Version 2.1 (Under development)
  - Paramter restrictions of alpha < 1/h1 (VG model) and hm > h1 (LN model),
    where h1 is the smallest suction head of the measured point, were imposed,
    because in certain cases inflection points of VG and LN models become too
    small while the saturated water content becomes unrealistically high.
    Some other fixes for parameter handling.

Version 2.0 (2015-06-07)
  - Release of stable version

Version 2.0-beta.9 (2014-09-24)
  - In a certain case reported by a user, "error: weighted residuals are
    not real" was returned from initial calculation of BC fit with leasqr.m.
    Error handling block was added to fix this problem. If you find further
    problem with your data, please report bug to the author.

Version 2.0-beta.7 (2014-09-17)
  - Setting option can be either equation or filename
  - Multiple setting without limitation of numbers
  - Manual in man page style was created.
  - configure script was created.
  - ./configure; (sudo) make install installs both program and man page.
  - Install.sh creates destination directory
  - Japanese document (README.ja.md)

Version 2.0-beta.4 (2014-09-11)
  - New feature to draw graphs of the result
  - Simple output mode
  - Read default setting at $HOME/.swrcfitrc and ./setting.txt
  - Up to 3 setting files from command line parameter
  - Show version with -v option
  - Revised Install.sh to work on cygwin

Version 1.3 (2014-09-07)
  - swrc.m and bimodal.m were combined to swrcfit, and unimodal
    and bimodal calculation is to be selected from setting.
  - Data file and setting file is specified with commandline option.
  - Sample data and result file were added.
  - User's manual was changed to markup file (README.md)
  - Some file names were changed.
  - Install script for Unix-like systems was made.

Version 1.2 (2007-09-02)

  - User's manual (manual.pdf) was made.
  - Correlation matrix and standard deviation is calculated in
    advanced mode of the calculation option.
  - Restiction of residual water content not becoming negative
    is set as a default.

Version 1.1 (HESSD version) (2007-06-05)

  - Identical to the program published as a supplementary file
    of HESSD journal (Hydrology and Earth System Sciences
    Discussions, 4: 407-437, 2007.)
  - BL model was added as a bimodal model (bimodal.m).
  - Option for imposing the restriction of positive value of
    residual water content (pqr) was added.

Version 1.0 (JJSSP version) (2007-06-05)

  - Identical to the program published in JJSSP journal
    (Journal of Japanese Society of Soil Physics, 105:67-78.)
